We managed to include more imporved functionality to the crosswords and the tick tack toe games which help the user better their game experience overall. We also worked on the backend and got that working to a vertain level but since it is still buggy we plan to fix those errors over the course of ski week."

THe login were bare and really buggy in many areas so in my next NATM project I plan to make my project better is terms of both my logic and the CSS styling cause i felt i slacked off on the styling which made the page look not that good."

I also like Ian's group's CPT project which was a animation, one that you create uning boxes and lines, so that was pretty cool as well. I also liked the real estate finder, the wepage looked really well built and had great functionality, the job finder was pretty cool too."
