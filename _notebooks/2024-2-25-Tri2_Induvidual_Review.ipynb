    "For the game dashboard i worked on two games, tic tac toe and crosswords. They two games are known many many and work in a simple way. The tic tac toe game uses user input by assigning X or O to the user and then using a pre defined set of mapping it checks for the 3 down or acorss or diagonnal pattern for the win. A harder version calcualtes the player's move and according plays the ai to make sure the player does not win. A sort of check function which as the name suggests checks if the user is close to winning and plays accrodingly.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the crosswords, it was not the exact gameplay of regular crossword but rather a rip off. The user is prompted with hints for the word and it given a timer to figure out the word. Alltough a bit buggy the corssword game aims to check for hte user's skill in identifying the words rather than being dependent on the board itslef. Overall with the hint the user must guess a certain amount of words in a specific amount of time."
