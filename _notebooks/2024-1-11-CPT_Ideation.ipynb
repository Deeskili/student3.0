This game unlike monopoly which have simple card and motor functions. In this Monopoly variation, players roll dice to move, gaining or losing money at each step. A computer opponent also moves randomly. Steal Money cards add strategy, offering chances to gain or lose cash. Random Event cards introduce choices like moving forward or backward. The goal is to reach $1000 first. The backend system manages user data and a leaderboard, tracking progress and showcasing financial success. "

    "4. Winning or Loosing: The sole purpose of the game is for either end of play to reach $1000 first.\n",
    "5. Role of User: The user only need to click a rool the dice button which enact gameplay on its own. We wish to minimize as much user interference as possible sticking to only rolling the dice which is said to be random as well.\n",
    "6. Keeping tally of score: Each game will be recorded with win or loss statistics along with the time taken to reach said conlcusion as well. \n",
    "7. Login Page: The login page is designed to not only have the monopoly based game but also statistics of the user's past game play. We plan to use a backend database such as SQLITE to store the data from precious gameplays and also manage to link it to the facial recognition software so that the correct statisitics are matched with the correct user.\n",
