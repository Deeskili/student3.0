# Night at the Musuem
**Glows:**
- The games we designed all worked, and everyone who played them said that they were fun. 
- Everyone on the team presented at least one aspect of the code
- Everyone on team knew what they were talking about, and how the code worked  

**Grows:**
- Facial Recognition Login still buggy - seems to allow everyone with a lighter skin complexion to login. Model not trained well enough. 
- Need to solve JWT Token issues
- Need to add and finalize backend leaderboard

# Impressive CSP Project: 

I really liked Dante's teams project, the clash royale based site. I like how he integrated the frontend and backend together, as well as the card pulling game, which I thought was really fun. Most of all, they really shined in their UI interface. I thought everything looked really polished. 

# Outside of CSP: 

I went with Austin and Eric to go check out the photography room next door. I saw some really good pictures, and one stood out to me: there was a black and white picture with pencils where only the tips of the pencils had color. I thought the editing they did was top notch, and it looked really professional.
